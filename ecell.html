            "LOGIC WILL GET YOU FROM A TO B.IMAGINATION WILL GET YOU EVERYWHERE"<br />- ALBERT EINSTEIN<br />
            Rules and norms are there, meant to be followed, for the smooth pliability of social wagons. And then there
            is imagination. Imagination is a strange thing. It is wild, it is silly. It is the fuel to all great
            revolutionaries that have taken place in the history of the world. Every human is entitled with this special
            gift. To imagine, to be free. Free to make our own choices. Free to shape ourselves. As children,
            imagination comes to us as naturally as breathing. As a child, we aren't afraid to become Superman or Miss
            Universe. As grown-up's, we all know what would happen if we declared in public that we would like to become
            Superman! Imagination dies a natural death along with childhood. An Entrepreneur differs from us in this
            very aspect. He isn't ashamed of his big, silly plans. He isn't afraid to fail or tired of getting up. He
            never stopped imagining. An entrepreneur is a leader, a driving force behind semiconscious process of
            intuition and insight, rooted in experience. Every successful entrepreneur has been a person who was able to
            identify the problem and come up with a solution to it before someone else did. An entrepreneur develops
            this vision and a strategy of how to implement it.
